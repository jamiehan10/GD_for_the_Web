		<p>This unit was about putting my manifesto into words. And then, publishing and enacting it.
		After creating a responsive website of my topic for manifesto–10 considerations for designers when working on: Multicultural Project and Sociopolitial Engagement–the method I reached out was to print as a memo pad to be installed in designer's physical workspace, and designing a mockup for website's mobile version to solve the website's limited function only able on desktop.</p>

		<p>It was a very interesting project, for which I could explore various methods more than any other previous units. Writing manifesto, proofreading and commenting, coding, using mockup software, printing and binding; all these process I've came through were helpful and refreshing. Also, for this project I had to think a lot more about words and language–which I think is a very critical thing to consider as designer. The most difficult thing other than technical limits I faced while coding was actually deciding what to list as manifesto and how to not lose the meaning as much as I can–even translating English to Korean, my first language, was a time-consuming part. Experience from this unit are so valuable and my future projects will definitely be influenced and benefit a lot from it.</p>

		<span>Unit 4 _ Circulate & Systematize</span><br><br><br>

		<p>The list of my manifesto was attached to whatever I send out, to clarify my purpose, give an example of manifesto format and make sure respondent can add something different and fresh.<br>
		<br>
		* However, this also confused some receipents:<br><br>
		<em>Thank you for extending this invitation to participate in your project.
		Actually, I do not fully understand your question as to whether am I supposed to tell you my own manifesto or choose one from the list above that I would resonate with. I will do both.</em></p><br><br>


		(1) In-class survey<br><br>

		<img src="https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T47JMK0SD-F56TVMNM9/circulating.jpg" width="170px">

		<img src="https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T47JMK0SD-F570LFWH0/circulating3.jpg" width="170px">
		<br><br>

		<p> This survey had to be revised because there wasn't a solid format of question made yet that responses were more like a list of keywords. It had to be revised somehow. Some on the list of answers included:<br><br>
		everyone’s point of view / inclusivity<br>
		research / communication<br>
		beginning in specific environment<br>
		audience / audience <br>
		contexts / perspectives <br>
		tone / word choice<br>
		environment / question <gr>
		cultural background</p>
		<br><br>


		(2) Sending out forms<br><br>

			&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="http://www.iconsdb.com/icons/preview/white/link-xxl.png" width="12px"><a href="https://docs.google.com/a/risd.edu/forms/d/1I5cGc1MY_qLBVhK4zDgalR3FAwL4-irx1rutQqss82I/edit" target="blank">&nbsp;&nbsp;Google Form</a><br><br><br>

		&nbsp;&nbsp;Questions included:<br>
		<p>Q1. What would be your manifesto for major consideration as designer/artist? (main question, required)&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;
		Q2. What was a difficulty you've gone through when publishing your design in other language or audience from different culture, especially when the content deals with sociopolitical issue? Can you briefly share your experience, or share your project?&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;Q3. What was your effort/method to overcome the difficulties? How did it resolve your design?<br><br><br>

		<br>(3) Sending mails <br><br>

		<img src="http://i66.tinypic.com/vmrp10.png" width="500px" height="400px" onmouseover="this.src='http://i64.tinypic.com/63sxdt.png'" onmouseout="this.src='http://i66.tinypic.com/vmrp10.png'" /><br><br>

		Mail was sent to risdgd-ds4, some risd senior/grad students, friends in other majors and random designers found on <u>trendlist.org</u>,individual websites or portfolio sites.<br><br>
		For two weeks, I contacted more about 40 designers outside of risd, sending them a mail individually. About 1/6 of them were willing to answer and submit manifesto, while few several of them provided me very long and thorough response.<br><br><br>
		<a href="http://www.trendlist.org/" target="blank"><img src="http://i67.tinypic.com/2dt3iir.png" width="500px"></a><br><br>
		
		Now I'm still receiving responses from designers, and I'll also send it out to more designers for diversity of contents.<br><br>
