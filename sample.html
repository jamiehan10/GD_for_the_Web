				<span>Q. What was a difficulty you've gone through when publishing your design in other language or audience from different culture, especially when the content deals with sociopolitical issue?</span><br><br>

				As a designer and citizen of South Korea, last year, 2016 was a tough year. We had a presidential impeachment issue and a sexual harassment in art scene. It always makes me feel powerless that when I faced up with sociopolitical problem but I can't do anything physically to solve the problem. This manifesto is the process of looking for answer what we can do as a designer. <br><br><br>

				<span>Q. What was your effort or method to overcome the difficulties? How did it resolve your work?</span><br><br>

				I would like to share the manifesto we wrote:<br><u>Almost rational manifesto</u><br><br>

				“It’s 2016, and we are living in a world full of unreason and imbalance. Witnessing great changes and faults in the process of realising equality and democracy, we felt powerless, angry, and lost . We started questioning ourselves how we can, as designers and artists, react on political, social, or economical phenomena which concerns us significantly.<br><br>

				We believe that we are not the only people who have struggled with this dilemma; wanting to act but not knowing how. As John Cage said once, “not knowing where to begin is a common form of paralysis. Begin anywhere.” So we have decided to begin here and now. We are tired of acting like we don’t care. We are tired of fearing to speak up when we know our opinions are worthy. We are frustrated and angry. Instead of waiting for the anger to dissolve while feeling frustrated and powerless, we will put these intangible feelings into a more tangible form in order to dig down deeper and learn, articulate, and present our views.<br>
				We will be persistent about this practice and attitude; at the same time we hope to provide a platform for other concerned comrades to share their point of views on issues that matter to them.<br><br>

				Our practice is based on:<br>
				&nbsp;· Sharing, observing, discussing and producing (re-create)<br>
				&nbsp;· Belief that honesty can lead to a solution<br>
				&nbsp;· Embracing our anger<br><br>

				We do not believe that we can single-handedly offer solutions like a super-hero to the social phenomena and problems we tackle; but as designers we aim to address the issues in a way that engages our audience.”<br><br>

			    <span>Q. What was a difficulty you've gone through when publishing your design(art) in other language or audience from different culture, especially when the content deals with sociopolitical issue?</span><br><br>

				I've designed several packaging products that had many variations, ones intended for:  America, Mexico, China, Korea, German, and several other cultures. <br><br><br>

				<span>Q. What was your effort or method to overcome the difficulties? How did it resolve your work?</span><br><br>

				This was early in my career, perhaps 12 years ago. Back then I didn't know the questions to ask, I simply had to make it happen. Not much support was given aside from translation (that to be honest came from people who were not experts in the languages). We certainly could have used better translators, but more importantly, what would have been helpful is if there was cultural translators — people reading everything beyond the text.... the images, the context, etc. and so forth.</p>

			    <p><span>Q. What was a difficulty you've gone through when publishing your design in other language or audience from different culture, especially when the content deals with sociopolitical issue?</span><br><br>

			    Establishing design in different languages was really great challenges. Even the power of language changed dramatically through translation, not mentioning other subtle things. Audiences from different cultures have different habits and ways of thinking. Such differences need numerous design practices to accurately engage with. Multi-linguistic projects or projects concerning multiple cultures really need experience and understanding in multiple cultures, which are often great barriers of great designs. For me, it's impossible to publish a design in other language by just changing a few things and still expect it to be great. The only way out is to redesign everything from scratch. <br><br>

			    <p><span>Q. What was a difficulty you've gone through when publishing your design(art) in other language or audience from different culture, especially when the content deals with sociopolitical issue?</span><br><br>

				Do more cultural research, ask people with more linguistic competence than me for help. Again, be brave to redesign from scratch.</p>

				The kind of difficulties mentioned here are present in just about every project I work on: a desire for work to be open to as wide and diverse an audience as possible. Sometimes it's more specific, in terms of either content or audience. Dealing with work produced by black artists (when I'm a white designer) and my desire to be as understanding and appropriate, while never assuming that such understanding could ever be total, and allowing the given content to speak for itself. (Often a matter of trying to keep out of the way as much as possible as a designer, while still doing my absolute best to fulfill the aforementioned mission: make work accessible to as wide an audience as possible. <br><br><br>

				<span>Q. What was your effort or method to overcome the difficulties? How did it resolve your work?</span><br><br>

				Point 1 of the manifesto above gets at what I consider the most fundamental and crucial aspect of design: dialogue. “Talk to people”. Be open to critique and maintain continuous, respectful, communication on an equal level with all involved: the content producers (writer/artist/etc.), the workers (editors, curators, printers, binders, security guards, everyone), and potential audiences (all of the above and anyone else inside and outside of the given field your project is coming from).</p>

				<p>
				In many ways I have resonated with this statement - On the fundamental level, what is 'good' design is always someone's opinion (think awards / your mentor).
				There is no fully empirical method to measure or assess design, in a way, design is therefore subjective. This is true on many levels for me as the designer is human, therefore no creation from him/her can be purely objective and sterile. The viewer(for this case, visual communication) is also human, and will also interpret the design in his/her own capacity, culture and visual literacy. <br><br>Therefore as designers we must be clear of our opinion / acknowledge it, and strive to get a message across to the viewer through the clearest possible visual language to combat the many levels of slippages.<br><br>
				This is especially relevant to the context as sociopolitical issues are intrinsically subjective and it is a designer's responsibility to ensure the intended opinion is carried across the design in the clearest way possible while remaining sensitive.<br><br><br>

				<span>Q. What was a difficulty you've gone through when publishing your design(art) in other language or audience from different culture, especially when the content deals with sociopolitical issue?</span><br><br>
				I have been on both the 'designing' and 'receiving' end of cross-cultural projects when working with overseas clients/collaborators, although the projects does not specifically deal with sociopolitical issue. However I believe the main issue is still language translation or transliteration. Every language has its relationship with the culture in which it resides in, and sometimes words in languages are tied to various signified which designers should pay attention to, when designing them. Also not forgetting to mention that many ideals of graphic design are largely western-centric and therefore it is important to be sensitive to the target audience and their respective cultures.<br><br><br>

				<span>Q. What was your effort or method to overcome the difficulties? How did it resolve your work?</span><br><br>
				Working with a translator closely is one way. In a way it is mandatory when designing for another language/culture. For example, as a ethnic chinese in Singapore fluent in Mandarin and English, I cannot safely say that I can translate ideas from English to Mandarin for an audience in let's say, China. This is because Mandarin, like many other languages, is diverse and differs slightly across different countries and cultures. <br><br></p>

				<p>
				I want to enjoy making the work before sending a specific message to the audience. Whatever the message, I believe that my conditions play an important role in delivering it effectively and successfully. When I want to state an issue, I make sure that I really know everything about it, so I don't unintentionally warp the truth, or send a wrong message. Most of the time I end up telling my own story, from life, memories, or experience.
				<br><br><br>

				<span>Q. What was a difficulty you've gone through when publishing your design(art) in other language or audience from different culture, especially when the content deals with sociopolitical issue? 
				</span><br><br>

				It's not really a difficulty, but when doing project related to my background or language, it needs more background information and explanation. This is inevitable when considering that the audience does not know about the culture. And because there is a limit to understanding it fully, so the audience would focus more on the aesthetics or the technical aspects of the piece first, or focus primarily on the concept of the piece. I haven't addressed a serious sociopolitical issue yet in my work, so it's hard for me to find more difficulties.
				<br><br><br>

				<span>Q. What was your effort or method to overcome the difficulties? How did it resolve your work?</span><br><br>

				I try to keep my pieces neutral in issues. Rather than trying to raise my voice against unfair treatments or misunderstanding, I want to bring light to the positive aspects. For the apparel piece, I used the transformation of Korean traditional attire to a more modern, wearable design. This wasn't a way of petitioning against the loss of tradition, but an evolution of design to suit more people while still keeping traditional elements. When also using a different language, I wouldn't focus on moments when not being able to speak english was painful, because those moments were very few compared to my whole life learning a new language. Rather, I take a more humorous, or casual approach, to tell the viewers that not all multicultural/sociopolitical art is based on mistreatment or loss of identity.</p>
