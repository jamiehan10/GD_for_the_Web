				<p><span>Q. What is your major consideration?</span><br><br>

				I want to enjoy making the work before sending a specific message to the audience. Whatever the message, I believe that my conditions play an important role in delivering it effectively and successfully. When I want to state an issue, I make sure that I really know everything about it, so I don't unintentionally warp the truth, or send a wrong message. Most of the time I end up telling my own story, from life, memories, or experience.
				<br><br><br>

				<span>Q. What was a difficulty you've gone through when publishing your design(art) in other language or audience from different culture, especially when the content deals with sociopolitical issue? 
				</span><br><br>

				It's not really a difficulty, but when doing project related to my background or language, it needs more background information and explanation. This is inevitable when considering that the audience does not know about the culture. And because there is a limit to understanding it fully, so the audience would focus more on the aesthetics or the technical aspects of the piece first, or focus primarily on the concept of the piece. I haven't addressed a serious sociopolitical issue yet in my work, so it's hard for me to find more difficulties.
				<br><br><br>

				<span>Q. What was your effort or method to overcome the difficulties? How did it resolve your work?</span><br><br>

				I try to keep my pieces neutral in issues. Rather than trying to raise my voice against unfair treatments or misunderstanding, I want to bring light to the positive aspects. For the apparel piece, I used the transformation of Korean traditional attire to a more modern, wearable design. This wasn't a way of petitioning against the loss of tradition, but an evolution of design to suit more people while still keeping traditional elements. When also using a different language, I wouldn't focus on moments when not being able to speak english was painful, because those moments were very few compared to my whole life learning a new language. Rather, I take a more humorous, or casual approach, to tell the viewers that not all multicultural/sociopolitical art is based on mistreatment or loss of identity.</p>

			    <p><span>Q. What is your major consideration?</span><br><br>

			    Find a partner/advisor that has a great deal of experience with the culture and ask if they be willing to offer advice. Before this happens, insist this project and all projects have budgeted time/money to support this effort.

				I've designed several packaging products that had many variations, ones intended for:  America, Mexico, China, Korea, German, and several other cultures. <br><br><br>

				<span>Q. What was your effort or method to overcome the difficulties? How did it resolve your work?</span><br><br>

				This was early in my career, perhaps 12 years ago. Back then I didn't know the questions to ask, I simply had to make it happen. Not much support was given aside from translation (that to be honest came from people who were not experts in the languages). We certainly could have used better translators, but more importantly, what would have been helpful is if there was cultural translators — people reading everything beyond the text.... the images, the context, etc. and so forth.</p>

			    <p><span>Q. What was a difficulty you've gone through when publishing your design(art) in other language or audience from different culture, especially when the content deals with sociopolitical issue?</span><br><br>

			    Establishing design in different languages was really great challenges. Even the power of language changed dramatically through translation, not mentioning other subtle things. Audiences from different cultures have different habits and ways of thinking. Such differences need numerous design practices to accurately engage with. Multi-linguistic projects or projects concerning multiple cultures really need experience and understanding in multiple cultures, which are often great barriers of great designs. For me, it's impossible to publish a design in other language by just changing a few things and still expect it to be great. The only way out is to redesign everything from scratch. <br><br>

			    <p><span>Q. What was a difficulty you've gone through when publishing your design(art) in other language or audience from different culture, especially when the content deals with sociopolitical issue?</span><br><br>

				Do more cultural research, ask people with more linguistic competence than me for help. Again, be brave to redesign from scratch.</p>

			    Imagine that you are personally talking to every single potential reader/viewer.
			   <br><br><br>

			   <span>Q. What was a difficulty you've gone through when publishing your design(art) in other language or audience from different culture, especially when the content deals with sociopolitical issue?</span><br><br>

				The kind of difficulties mentioned here are present in just about every project I work on: a desire for work to be open to as wide and diverse an audience as possible. Sometimes it's more specific, in terms of either content or audience. Dealing with work produced by black artists (when I'm a white designer) and my desire to be as understanding and appropriate, while never assuming that such understanding could ever be total, and allowing the given content to speak for itself. (Often a matter of trying to keep out of the way as much as possible as a designer, while still doing my absolute best to fulfil the aforementioned mission: make work accessible to as wide an audience as possible. <br><br><br>

				<span>Q. What was your effort or method to overcome the difficulties? How did it resolve your work?</span><br><br>

				Point 1 of the manifesto above gets at what I consider the most fundamental and crucial aspect of design: dialogue. “Talk to people”. Be open to critique and maintain continuous, respectful, communication on an equal level with all involved: the content producers (writer/artist/etc.), the workers (editors, curators, printers, binders, security guards, everyone), and potential audiences (all of the above and anyone else inside and outside of the given field your project is coming from).</p>

				<p><span>Q. What is your major consideration?</span><br><br>

				Use medium thoughtfully and make sure it matches effectively to your intended theme and message.<br><br><br>

				<span>Q. What was a difficulty you've gone through when publishing your design(art) in other language or audience from different culture, especially when the content deals with sociopolitical issue?</span><br><br>

				As a designer and citizen, last year, 2016 was a tough year. We had a presidential impeachment issue and a sexual harassment in art scene. It always makes me feel powerless that when I faced up with sociopolitical problem but I can't do anything physically to solve the problem. This manifesto is the process of looking for answer what we can do as a designer. <br><br><br>

				<span>Q. What was your effort or method to overcome the difficulties? How did it resolve your work?</span><br><br>

				I would like to share the manifesto I wrote down with Marika Seo: <em>Almost rational manifesto</em><br><br>

				It’s 2016, and we are living in a world full of unreason and imbalance. Witnessing great changes and faults in the process of realising equality and democracy, we felt powerless, angry, and lost . We started questioning ourselves how we can, as designers and artists, react on political, social, or economical phenomena which concerns us significantly.<br><br>

				We believe that we are not the only people who have struggled with this dilemma; wanting to act but not knowing how. As John Cage said once, “not knowing where to begin is a common form of paralysis. Begin anywhere.” So we have decided to begin here and now. We are tired of acting like we don’t care. We are tired of fearing to speak up when we know our opinions are worthy. We are frustrated and angry. Instead of waiting for the anger to dissolve while feeling frustrated and powerless, we will put these intangible feelings into a more tangible form in order to dig down deeper and learn, articulate, and present our views.<br>
				We will be persistent about this practice and attitude; at the same time we hope to provide a platform for other concerned comrades to share their point of views on issues that matter to them.<br><br>

				Our practice is based on:<br>
				· Sharing, observing, discussing and producing (re-create)<br>
				· Belief that honesty can lead to a solution<br>
				· Embracing our anger<br><br>

				We do not believe that we can single-handedly offer solutions like a super-hero to the social phenomena and problems we tackle; but as designers we aim to address the issues in a way that engages our audience.<br><br>
