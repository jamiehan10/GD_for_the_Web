	<p>The advent of computer operating systems: Macintosh's classic operating system was first released in 1984, called "System 1".</br>Microsoft released "Windows 1.0" in November 1985, which was the first version of Microsoft Windows series.</br>Basic designs indicating certain function and icons were made in these earlier stages, but media player wasn't publicized yet.</br>Some aspects of fundamental design to be developed can be found from volume bars and icons.</p>

	<h3><span style= "color:white">Early~mid 1990s</span></h3>
	<p>Two operating systems' iconic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_player_(software)">media players</a> were made in this period. Quicktime player and Windows Media Player(WMP) of this time show basic and flat design.</br>They have standard media control icons such as play, pause, fastforward, backforward, and stop buttons.</p>

		<ul>
			<li><h4>Quicktime Player</h4></li>
				<p>QuickTime, first made in 1991, is an extensible multimedia framework developed by Apple Inc.,</br>capable of handling various formats of digital video, picture, sound, panoramic images, and interactivity.</p>

	<h3><span style= "color:white">Late 1990s~Early 2000s</span></h3>
	<p>More music player softwares release. Apple took over SoundJam MP and opened iTunes.</br>Also, famous media player Winamp was released in 1997 and was popularly used as the sole option for playing MP3-compressed music on Microsoft Windows.</br>Initial designs were not very different from those of early 1990s, remaining in gray rectangular boxes, but icons had more color and dimensionality than before.</br>Advent of P2P websites lead more development of various media players.</br>
	Customized player softwares for vernacular, amateuristic and personal websites were more widely developed by the users.</br>
	People were big fan of 'creating own skins' that could be applied to show off their individuality.</p>
